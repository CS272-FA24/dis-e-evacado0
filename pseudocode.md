1. Collect the books
2. Pick up one book and put it first in the bookshelf
3. Pick up a second book not on the bookshelf already
4. If the first letter of the title of the picked up book comes before the first letter of the title of the book farthest to the right, put the second book to the left of the first book. If it comes later in the alphabet, put it to the right of the first book. If the first letter of both titles are the same, repeat this step but look at the second letter of the titles.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all the books are on the bookshelf
